## Upcoming

### The Reproducibility Crisis

#### 12 October, 2018, 12-1pm, Clark Center, S361

[Munaf√≤ MR, Nosek BA, Bishop, DV, Button, KS, Chambers CD, Sert NP, Simonsohn U, Wagenmakers E, Ware JJ, Ioannidis JP. A manifesto for reproducible science. 2017. Nature Human Behaviour, 1:0021.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021)

Our inaugural talk! This will be hosted by none other than Prof. John Ioannidis, MD, DSc, co-director of [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/), one of the world leaders in research on research and the second most widely cited scientist at Stanford. Prof. Ioannidis will talk about the _Reproducibility Crisis_. Each of our talks will be paired to a relevant article to familiarize the scientific community with the vast literature in the area, which is unfortunately not widely known. You are encouraged to read the article before attending. **Free food** will be available!

## Future

### P-values: What They Truly Are and How to Not Misuse Them

#### TBD - sometime in December

[Wasserstein RL, Lazar NA. The ASA's Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose. 2016. Am Stat, 70(2):129-33.](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.W6AWAP5Kh25)

Prof. Steven Goodman, MD, PhD, is the co-director of [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) and a biostatistician working on statistical inference, Bayesian statistics and their application to practical data analysis. He is one of the world experts in p-values and he will be taking us through what p-values are, common misconceptions (e.g. "the probability of my results being due to chance"), how to use them appropriately and future replacements of p-values. As always, this talk is paired to a relevant article, which you are encouraged to read before attending. **Free food** will be available!

### Open Science in Practice

#### 9 November, 2018, 12-1pm, Alway Building, M112

[Klein O, Hardwicke TE, Aust F, Breuer J, Danielsson H, Mohr AF, Ijzerman H, Nilsonne G, Vanpaemel W, Frank MC. A practical guide for transparency in psychological science. 2018. Collabra: Psychology, 4(1):20.](https://collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.158/)

Tom Hardwicke, PhD, is a post-doc at [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) and an expert in open science practices and methods to improve science reproducibility, such as pre-registered reports. He will take us through what Open Science is and illustrate the tools we can use to actually go about practicing open science. As always, this talk is paired to a relevant article, which you are encouraged to read before attending. **Free food** will be available!
