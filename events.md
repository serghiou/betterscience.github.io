Our inaugural talk! This will be hosted by none other than Prof. John Ioannidis of [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/), one of the worldwide leaders in the field and the second most widely cited scientist at Stanford. Prof. Ioannidis will talk about the _Reproducibility Crisis_. Each of our talks will be paired to a relevant published article to familiarize the scientific community with the vast literature in the area, to which unfortunately not many are exposed. **Free food** will be available!
