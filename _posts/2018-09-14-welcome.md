Welcome to our initiative for reproducible science at Stanford! Even though many reports have indicated that much of the published research is non-reproducible (i.e. false) and that most of the funding for biomedical science is wasted, we still practice science that got us where we are. This is because there is no incentive for us to change. However, the problem is that we do not get to actually learn the science that we should be practicing. Stanford is home to the biggest insitute dedicated to changing the practice of science, METRICS, and we felt that we ought to communicate its work to the rest of the scientific community at Stanford.

This is why this initiative will aim to do exactly that. We will host talks, workshops, journal clubs, maintain helpful resources and connect the Biosciences community to entities interested in rigorous experimental design, data analysis and research communication.  We also have many super exciting plans in store for the future!

We are looking forward to seeing you at our first event, on Friday, October 12, 12-1pm, at Clark Center (S361). This  will be headlined by, most probably, the most renouned meta-researcher in the world and director of METRICS, Prof. John Ioannidis.
