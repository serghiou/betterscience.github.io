Welcome to our initiative for reproducible science at Stanford!

Biomedical science is going through a reproducibility crisis (https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124), requiring a careful look at the way science is conducted. We, as PhD students and the next generation of scientists, are in a unique position to [imporve the reproducibility](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001747) of future findings.

This initiative aims to do exactly that. We aim to host talks, workshops, journal clubs, maintain helpful resources and connect the Biosciences community to others interested in rigorous scientific practice, experimental design, data analysis and research communication. We hope that, in the process, we will build a community of scientists equipped to practice how we now know we should be practicing science. We also have many super exciting plans in store for the future!

Have a look at [About us](https://serghiou.github.io/aboutus/) to learn more about our mission and keep an eye on our [Events](https://serghiou.github.io/events/) page for our monthly set of events. Our first event witll be on on Friday, October 12, 12-1pm, at Clark Center (S361). In this inaugural talk we will be hosting Prof. John Ioannidis, director of [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) and, probably, the most renouned meta-researcher in the world!

Also have a look at our [Resources](https://serghiou.github.io/resources/) of materials you can use to learn about the current state of biomedical research, how to practice more rigorous science and how to develop appropriate data analysis skills.

**Stay up to date** with our events, content and opportunities by subscribing to our [email list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/reproducible-science). If you'd like to join our team, send us an email [here](mailto:sstelios@stanford.edu).

We are looking forward to meeting you in person!
