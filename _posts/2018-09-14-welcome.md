Welcome to our initiative for reproducible science at Stanford!

Even though it is now widely accepted that biomedical science is going through a [reproducibility crisis](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970), the majority of the scientific community is barely aware of the reasons behind it and no available courses at Stanford attempt to systematically teach us PhD students how to [publish more reproducible research](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001747).

This initiative aims to do exactly that. We will host talks, workshops, journal clubs, maintain helpful resources and connect the Biosciences community to others interested in rigorous scientific practice, experimental design, data analysis and research communication. We also have many super exciting plans in store for the future!

Have a look at [About us](https://serghiou.github.io/aboutus/) to learn more about our mission and keep an eye on our [Events](https://serghiou.github.io/events/) page for our monthly set of events. Our first event witll be on on Friday, October 12, 12-1pm, at Clark Center (S361). In this inaugural talk we will be hosting Prof. John Ioannidis, director of [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) and, probably, the most renouned meta-researcher in the world!

Also have a look at our [Resources](https://serghiou.github.io/resources/) of materials you can use to learn about the current state of biomedical research, how to practice more rigorous science and how to develop appropriate data analysis skills.

**Stay up to date** with our events, content and opportunities by subscribing to our [email list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/reproducible-science). If you'd like to join our team, send us an email [here](mailto:sstelios@stanford.edu).

We are looking forward to meeting you in person!
