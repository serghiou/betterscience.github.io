Welcome to our initiative for reproducible science at Stanford!

It is increasingly apparent that most published research findings in the biosciences are in fact [false](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) and that most of research funding in the biosciences is in fact [wasted](https://www.thelancet.com/series/research). This state of affairs has recently become known as the _reproducibility crisis_.

Many recommendations have been made to help scientists publish research that is more likely true, such as making all data openly available, making detailed protocols available, making all experimental results available ("positive" or "negative"), publishing reproducibility attempts, abiding by reporting guidelines in writing a manuscript, not using p-values, and many more. However, the majority of the scientific community is barely aware of the problems with current research practices and no available courses at Stanford attempt to systematically teach us PhD students about proposed solutions.

This initiative aims to do exactly that. We will host talks, workshops, journal clubs, maintain helpful resources and connect the Biosciences community to others interested in rigorous experimental design, data analysis and research communication. We also have many super exciting plans in store for the future!

We are looking forward to seeing you at our first event, on Friday, October 12, 12-1pm, at Clark Center (S361). In this inaugural talk we will be hosting Prof. John Ioannidis, director of [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) and, probably, the most renouned meta-researcher in the world. You can inspect all of our events on our [Events](https://serghiou.github.io/events/) page.

Also have a look at our [Resources](https://serghiou.github.io/resources/) of materials you can use to learn about the current state of biomedical research and how to produce more reproducible science.

Stay up to date with our events, content and opportunities by subscribing to our [email list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/reproducible-science). If you'd like to join our team, send us an email [here](mailto:sstelios@stanford.edu).

We are looking forward to meeting you in person!
