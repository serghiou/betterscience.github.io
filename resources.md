## Books

### State of research

* [Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes Hope, and Wastes Billions.](https://smile.amazon.com/Rigor-Mortis-Science-Worthless-Billions/dp/154164414X/) A fantastic book by Richard Harris published in 2017 on the current state of biomedical research. Very well written, an easy read, a great resource of citations and the best introduction to the topic I have read so far.

* [I Think You'll Find It's a Bit More Complicated Than That.](https://smile.amazon.com/Think-Youll-Find-More-Complicated/dp/0007462484/) A fantastic book written by Ben Goldacre, well-known science writter for The Guardian and proponent of transparent clinical research. This book illustrates current problems with clinical research through stark real-worl examples. An easy read and page-turner.

* [Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks.](https://smile.amazon.com/Bad-Science-Quacks-Pharma-Flacks/dp/0865479186/) Another book by Ben Goldacre. This was published in 2010 and is his first book on the topic. A book about poor reporting of medical studies in the media and what goes wrong in medical research.

* [Bad Pharma.](https://smile.amazon.com/Bad-Pharma-Companies-Mislead-Patients/dp/0865478066/) Another book by Ben Goldacre. This was published in 2014 and goes through the shockingly broekn system of pharmaceutical industry and how it has had a detrimental impact on medicine through data manipulation and research misconduct.

### Statistics

* [Statistics Done Wrong: The Woefully Complete Guide.](https://smile.amazon.com/Statistics-Done-Wrong-Woefully-Complete/dp/1593276206/) Statistics is one of the most important tools we have in learning from data. However, statistical analysis is not trivial and is often done wrong. This book goes through statistical blunders in major publications and often misunderstood concepts, such as the p-value. A very easy and quick read.

* [How to lie with statistics.](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728/) "Darrell Huff runs the gamut of every popularly used type of statistic, probes such things as the sample study, the tabulation method, the interview technique, or the way the results are derived from the figures, and points up the countless number of dodges which are used to full rather than to inform."

* [What is a p-value anyway? 34 Stories to Help You Actually Understand Statistics.](https://smile.amazon.com/p-value-Stories-Actually-Understand-Statistics/dp/0321629302) "What is a p-value Anyway? offers a fun introduction to the fundamental principles of statistics, presenting the essential concepts in thirty-four brief, enjoyable stories. Drawing on his experience as a medical researcher, Vickers blends insightful explanations and humor, with minimal math, to help readers understand and interpret the statistics they read every day."

## Courses

* [STATS 211: Meta-research: Appraising Research Findings, Bias, and Meta-analysis.](http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&q=STATS211) An introduction to appraising scientific research, understanding what is wrong with today's research, how it could be better and how to use systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize multiple lines of evidence into single values/recommendations.

* [HRP 264: Foundations of Statistical and Scientific Inference.](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&q=hrp264) A fantastic introduction by Prof. Steve Goodman on what we actually mean about probability, the philosophical principles that underly the methods that we use to make sense of data, relevant controversies and how to make sense of p-values and research reproducibility.

* [MOOC: Transparent and Open Social Science Research.](https://www.bitss.org/events/mooc-transparent-and-open-social-science-research-2/) This is offered online by [BITSS (Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences)](https://www.bitss.org/). "Demand for evidence-based policy is growing, but so is recognition that limited transparency in social science research has contributed to what many have called a crisis of reproducibility and credibility. With this 5-week, self-paced Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), you can explore the causes of limited transparency in social science research, as well as tools to make your own work more open and reproducible." Even though the linked iteration of the course is over, you can download all materials for free and the course is held a number of times per year.

## Other

* [Meta-research on Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/metaresearch/) A community for anyone interested in improving how science is done. It contains hundreds of recommended articles on issues related to better science. Feel free to read through them and contribute your own.

* [Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford.](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) A center at Stanford dedicated to research about research. "In partnership with researchers, policymakers and other key stakeholders, the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS) is reimagining science for the 21st century with the goal of strengthening the research enterprise to improve the quality of scientific studies in biomedicine and beyond."

## Similar initiatives elsewhere

* [Reproducible Research Oxford.](https://rroxford.github.io/) Apparently there is a very similar initiative at the University of Oxford, which for the time being appears much better staffed and funded...

* [Open Science Community Utrecht.](https://openscience-utrecht.com/) Utrecht University has been a long-standing proponent of Open Science, so it is no surprise this initiative exists. They apparently host a bi-monthly informal Open Science Caf√©, have a brought multidisciplinary community across the university and host workshops about once every two months.
