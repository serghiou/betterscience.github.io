## The mission

It is increasingly apparent that most published research findings in the biosciences are in fact [false](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) and that most of research funding in the biosciences is in fact [wasted](https://www.thelancet.com/series/research). This state of affairs has recently become known as the _reproducibility crisis_.

Many recommendations have been made to help scientists publish research that is more likely true, such as making all data openly available, making detailed protocols available, making all experimental results available ("positive" or "negative"), publishing reproducibility attempts, abiding by reporting guidelines in writing a manuscript, not using p-values, and many more. However, the majority of the scientific community is barely aware of the trials and tribulations with current research practices and no available courses at Stanford attempt to systematically teach us PhD students about proposed solutions.

This is despite Stanford being home to one of the most distinguished institutes in the world doing research about research, [METRICS (Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford)](https://metrics.stanford.edu/). We plan to use the expertise developed by the group of scientists working in this institute to disseminate what is known about the state of current research practices in the biosciences, discuss why this is the case and identify how to go about practicing rigorous and uncompromising science.

We plan to host talks on such issues as the reproducibility crisis and the scientific method, workshops on such issues as practicing open science and understanding p-values, create a resource of relevant materials, familiarize all graduate students with these issues and many more. We want this to be an active community and we consider everyone responsible in shaping the "many more" aspects of this initiative.

Overall, we hope that this initiative will create a collective of young scientists interested in spearheading a paradigm shift in how we go about practicing and communicating scientific research.
